# Website Job Scraper With Puppeteer

This project was equal parts an excuse to try out puppeteer and a so my wife didn't need to go to this site to see if any new jobs were posted.

The framework of the scraper could be mostly copied and applied to another website, with only the puppeteer actions changed to fit whatever is needed.

## Built with

- Node.js
- Puppeteer
- NodeMailer
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- Heroku Scheduler
